# Info
This is my first real life project made for a friend.

The only thing I do not like about this site are colors, I had to use the existing ones and I'm not really happy with them.

The site still looks like, it's not indexed by google, because it was recently (a the start of April) deployed.

Also 2 subpages are not quite ready yet, I want to prevent all the images loading at the same time.

# Stack
Technologies I used in this project are:
- Gatsby
- Styled-components
- graphql

For managing content I'm using Contentful.

For hosting the site I'm using Netlify, domain is stored outside of the netlify.
